necromancer: Hello, simpleton peasant. Is this where I can equip?
necromancer: Arm myself? Prepare for battle?
necromancer: I'm not looking for any of your brutish death-tools. I need something refined.
necromancer: I am from the temple up north. Someone stole something... precious to me. Something I need to control some footfolk, a few loyal servants of mine. To secure their undying loyalty.
necromancer: Nothing too morally indefensible, but something to keep a large group of people in check.
necromancer: In any case, it's gone now. No use crying over lost, priceless, invaluable and rare artifacts. What's done is done. If only I could get a hand on the scoundrel who did it...
necromancer: Well, well, well. I still need to finish a certain ritual of mine and that I cannot do with rogue, unionizing minions.

necromancer: Can you give me something? Something to... nudge people's behaviour in the direction of my wishes?
- What do you want to do?
	necromancer: Finish a ritual that I started. If I cannot finish it, well...
	necromancer: Let's just say my soul is forfeit. And that is to be avoided.
	necromancer: My minions won't listen to my command, so I need something to keep them in check again. After all, I need compliant people to help me achieve what I need.

- What environment?
	necromancer: In my temple. Under the eyes of god, of course. Everything I do is for the better good.

- What's your strategy?
	necromancer: As of now, I can keep them in check with some witty argumentation, carefully crafted lies and empty promises.
	necromancer: But people will be going rogue once they realize just how empty these promises are.

- I have something for you....
necromancer: Thank you. I hope this will help
