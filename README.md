## Inspiration
We came here with the idea to build a game.
Continental's pitch (keeping people safe on their way/travel), together with the theme of this years' hackaburg and our planned fantasy setting, inspired our game idea.

## What it does
You play as a merchant who arms adventurers and warriors.
Customers come in and you can chat them up, asking them about their goals and their challenges that they expect.
Choosing the right weapon and gear is goal to keeping them secure.
At the same time, you have to manage your finances and inventory.

## How we built it
We chose Godot as our game engine. 
All art is done exclusively by our 2D-Artist, without the use of AI.

## Challenges we ran into
Good art takes a long time.
Doing research on engines and deciding on the correct one for our game.
Writing good dialogue with subleties to let you know which weapon could be the best is not easy.
None of us have experience with game engines.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We finished a prototype together with some cool concept art.
We taught ourselves how to use the basics of Godot.
We were able to coordinate the team of people with different capabilities (developers, artist, writers) with efficiency.

## What we learned
* Godot + Gdscript
* Git (at least our artist did)

## What's next for Gear4Fear
Some of our ideas include:
* Finishing art and dialogue
* Connecting story lines for fleshed out characters
* Multi-facetted economy system to manage your shop inventory
* and much more :)
